# AGENTS.md

This file is the automatically loaded entry point for AI agents working in an
AGIT Documentation Template repository. Keep it concise: it routes agents to
the repository's authoritative guidance and does not replace that guidance.

## Before Substantive Work

1. Read `CODEX.md` in full before using tools or changing files. It defines the
   local operating policy, sensitive-source boundaries and protected Git actions.
2. Read `ChatGPT.md` for the documentation collaboration model.
3. Read `README.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `REPOSITORY.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`,
   `PROJECT_SETUP.md` and `DOCS_SETUP.md` as relevant to the task.
4. Read the affected domain guidance, including `DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md`,
   `DOCUMENTATION_TYPE_PROFILES.md`, `FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md`, `QUARTO.md`,
   `AUDIENCE.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, `LINKS.md` and
   `VISUAL_QA.md` where applicable.
5. For initialization, continuation, harmonization or retrospective work,
   follow the corresponding prompt file instead of reconstructing its workflow.

If repository guidance appears inconsistent, report the conflict and ask for a
maintainer decision when it could materially affect the result.

## Working Agreement

- Confirm the active repository and inspect its current Git state before edits.
- Preserve existing staged selections, working-tree changes and unrelated work.
- Treat documentation intent, information architecture, technical truth and
  publication decisions as maintainer-owned.
- Treat maintained repository sources as authoritative over rendered or
  annotated DOCX, PDF and website review files.
- Do not inspect potentially sensitive screenshots, logs, exports, tickets or
  operational material without maintainer approval.
- Classify new external files through `input/`; presence in `input/intake/`
  never authorizes assistant access.
- Keep audience, navigation, links, visuals, feedback handling and maintained
  source synchronized across affected documentation.
- Follow the authorization rules in `CODEX.md`; an edit request does not by
  itself authorize protected Git actions or publication.

## Validation and Handoff

Run checks proportionate to the affected formats: local-link validation, Quarto
rendering, technical review, visual QA and disclosure review where applicable.
At minimum, review the diff and run `git diff --check`. Compare English and
German structure when bilingual documentation is affected.

Report the outcome, changed files, checks performed, limitations or skipped
checks and suitable commit metadata. A successful render alone does not prove
technical correctness, audience fitness or publication readiness.
