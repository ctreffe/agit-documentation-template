# Changelog

All notable changes to this template will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` for reproducible documentation-project re-entry in a
  new context window or assistant session.
- Documentation Collaboration Model v0.3.0 with formal working-commit rhythm,
  structured initialization completion and numbered maintainer collaboration.
- Git history control-word guidance for English and German maintainer instructions.
- AI Collaboration Notes to the English and German READMEs.
- AGIT Templateverse sections to the English and German READMEs.
- Shared `decisions/` Decision Record location with DDR, PDR and ADR templates.
- Setup guidance requiring derived documentation projects to preserve a visible AI Collaboration Note linked to `ChatGPT.md`.
- Concrete AI Collaboration Note wording describing documented documentation practices, AI-assisted workflows, QA discipline and repository conventions.

### Changed

- Retain initialization artifacts as project provenance and record template
  lineage, lifecycle status and harmonization baselines in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Expand `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with current-work, relevant-document and
  next-session fields needed for reliable continuation.
- Separate assistant access, Git versioning and publication approval for raw
  sources, reviewed derivatives and generated documentation.
- Extend disclosure review to rendered and embedded output surfaces and define
  automated checks as warnings rather than safety approval.
- Add a standard checkpoint handoff and maintainer approval gate for external
  review feedback.
- Require human-readable executable Quarto chunks when a project uses them.
- Require consistent commit summaries and meaningful descriptions while
  reserving milestone commits for separate reviewed closure.
- Strengthen safeguards against adding sensitive raw documentation sources to
  Git.
