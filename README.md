Template for AI-assisted technical documentation in AGIT contexts, with repository-first workflows, link discipline, screenshots, visual QA, and documented decisions.

This repository provides a starting point for technical documentation projects that should be maintained with the same rigor as software and scientific writing projects: explicit context, clear ownership, reproducible collaboration, documented decisions, and reviewable milestones.

German README: [README.de.md](README.de.md)

## Core principle

The maintainer owns the documentation intent, structure, technical correctness, audience fit, and final publication decision at all times. The AI assistant supports drafting, consistency checks, link discipline, screenshot and visual QA, structural feedback, and repository maintenance, but does not replace maintainer judgment.

## What this template is for

Use this template for documentation projects such as:

- User guides, admin guides, and operating procedures.
- Technical concepts, architecture notes, and implementation documentation.
- Troubleshooting, migration, setup, and release documentation.
- Documentation systems that combine prose, screenshots, diagrams, links, and generated output.

## AGIT Templateverse

The public AGIT templates form a small templateverse: a family of related templates that share a repository-first, maintainer-led Human-AI collaboration model while specializing it for different project types.

- [AGIT Project Template](https://github.com/ctreffe/agit-project-template) is the generic starting point for structured project work, research, planning, concept work, process design and mixed projects.
- [AGIT Dev Template](https://github.com/ctreffe/agit-dev-template) is for development-oriented projects where code, scripts, automation, validation, architecture or release workflows are central.
- [AGIT Documentation Template](https://github.com/ctreffe/agit-docs-template) is for technical documentation projects such as user guides, admin guides, operating procedures, tutorials, migration guides and documentation sites.

Start from the Documentation Template when audience, structure, screenshots, links, visual QA and publication format are central from the beginning. Start from the generic Project Template when documentation is only one part of a broader project.

## Repository workflow

1. Start from [INITIAL_PROMPT.md](INITIAL_PROMPT.md).
2. Complete [PROJECT_SETUP.md](PROJECT_SETUP.md) and [DOCS_SETUP.md](DOCS_SETUP.md).
3. Define project-specific context and record the source-template baseline and initialization status in [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).
4. Establish documentation type, audience, bilingual needs, Quarto structure,
   feedback channels, link, screenshot, and visual QA rules.
5. Draft documentation in small, reviewable increments.
6. Record substantial decisions in `decisions/`, usually as DDRs.
7. Close meaningful milestones with changelog, version, and consistency review.
8. Use [HARMONIZATION_PROMPT.md](HARMONIZATION_PROMPT.md) when the maintainer requests source-template, internal-consistency and roadmap alignment.
9. Use [RETROSPECTIVE_PROMPT.md](RETROSPECTIVE_PROMPT.md) when the maintainer requests a collaboration review.
10. Begin later context windows or assistant sessions with [CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md](CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md).

## Git Index and Protected Git Actions

Staging and unstaging are index operations and do not require a control word.
They still require a specific maintainer request or authorization of the
corresponding commit, and existing staged selections must be preserved.

AI assistants must not commit, amend, tag, push, pull, merge, rebase, reset,
switch branches, manipulate stashes or perform another protected Git action
unless the maintainer instruction for that specific action contains a
recognized control word.

Recognized control words are `explicit` and `explicitly` in English-language instructions, and the German word family `explizit`, including inflected forms such as `explizite`, `expliziten`, `expliziter` and `explizites`, in German-language instructions. Requests for protected Git actions without one of these control words authorize preparation and guidance only.

## Maintainer setup

For a new Codex-based documentation project, use this setup sequence:

1. Create a new repository from this template and clone it locally.
2. Open the repository as the active Codex workspace.
3. Install the Quarto CLI from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.
4. Open a new terminal and verify Quarto with `quarto --version`.
5. If PDF output is required, install a TeX toolchain, for example with `quarto install tinytex`.
6. Verify the Quarto baseline with `quarto render`.
7. Start project initialization with [INITIAL_PROMPT.md](INITIAL_PROMPT.md).
8. Complete [PROJECT_SETUP.md](PROJECT_SETUP.md), [DOCS_SETUP.md](DOCS_SETUP.md), and [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).

R and RStudio are useful when the documentation includes R code, data analysis, plots, or R-based Quarto extensions, but they are not required for simple Markdown-based documentation.

initialization provenance. Their lifecycle status, initial template version and
commit, later harmonization baselines and intentional deviations belong in
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
