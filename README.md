# AGIT Documentation Template

Template for AI-assisted technical documentation in AGIT contexts, with repository-first workflows, link discipline, screenshots, visual QA, and documented decisions.

This repository provides a starting point for technical documentation projects that should be maintained with the same rigor as software and scientific writing projects: explicit context, clear ownership, reproducible collaboration, documented decisions, and reviewable milestones.

German README: [README.de.md](README.de.md)

## Core principle

The maintainer owns the documentation intent, structure, technical correctness, audience fit, and final publication decision at all times. The AI assistant supports drafting, consistency checks, link discipline, screenshot and visual QA, structural feedback, and repository maintenance, but does not replace maintainer judgment.

## What this template is for

Use this template for documentation projects such as:

- User guides, admin guides, and operating procedures.
- Technical concepts, architecture notes, and implementation documentation.
- Troubleshooting, migration, setup, and release documentation.
- Documentation systems that combine prose, screenshots, diagrams, links, and generated output.

## Repository workflow

1. Start from [INITIAL_PROMPT.md](INITIAL_PROMPT.md).
2. Complete [PROJECT_SETUP.md](PROJECT_SETUP.md) and [DOCS_SETUP.md](DOCS_SETUP.md).
3. Define project-specific context in [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).
4. Establish documentation type, audience, bilingual needs, Quarto structure, link, screenshot, and visual QA rules.
5. Draft documentation in small, reviewable increments.
6. Record substantial documentation decisions as DDRs.
7. Close meaningful milestones with changelog, version, and consistency review.

## Maintainer setup

For a new Codex-based documentation project, use this setup sequence:

1. Create a new repository from this template and clone it locally.
2. Open the repository as the active Codex workspace.
3. Install the Quarto CLI from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.
4. Open a new terminal and verify Quarto with `quarto --version`.
5. If PDF output is required, install a TeX toolchain, for example with `quarto install tinytex`.
6. Verify the Quarto baseline with `quarto render`.
7. Start project initialization with [INITIAL_PROMPT.md](INITIAL_PROMPT.md).
8. Complete [PROJECT_SETUP.md](PROJECT_SETUP.md), [DOCS_SETUP.md](DOCS_SETUP.md), and [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).

R and RStudio are useful when the documentation includes R code, data analysis, plots, or R-based Quarto extensions, but they are not required for simple Markdown-based documentation.
