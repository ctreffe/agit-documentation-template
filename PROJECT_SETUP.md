# Project Setup

Use this file when creating a concrete documentation project from the template.

Some setup files in this template may remain in derived projects as documentation of the initialization process. They may also be marked as completed or archived if the maintainer prefers. Do not delete initialization files automatically unless the maintainer explicitly chooses that approach.

## Initialization checklist

1. Confirm repository identity.
   - Project name.
   - Repository URL.
   - Maintainer.
   - License model.

2. Confirm documentation type.
   - User guide, admin guide, technical concept, API reference, migration guide, troubleshooting guide, release documentation, operating procedure, or mixed documentation set.

3. Confirm documentation scope.
   - What is included.
   - What is out of scope.
   - What existing material should be reused.

4. Confirm audience.
   - Primary users.
   - Technical background.
   - Tasks they need to perform.
   - Risks the documentation should prevent.

5. Confirm source and sensitivity model.
   - Raw screenshots, logs, exports, tickets, URLs, configuration files, or source documents.
   - Sensitive or personal information.
   - Sanitization or redaction requirements.
   - Which raw sources, reviewed derivatives and generated outputs may be
     versioned, and which `.gitignore` rules must exist before source files are
     added to the working tree.

6. Confirm visual documentation model.
   - Screenshot policy.
   - Diagram policy.
   - Naming and storage rules.
   - Visual QA expectations.

7. Confirm link model.
   - Internal navigation.
   - External references.
   - Link checking expectations.
   - Stable source references.

8. Adapt template files.
   - Preserve an AI Collaboration Note directly below the README title and badges, if badges are present.
   - Keep the note visible, factually correct for the derived project, and linked to `ChatGPT.md`.
   - Include one concrete sentence describing what the collaboration model documents for the derived documentation project, such as documentation practices, collaboration workflows, link discipline, visual QA or repository conventions.
   - Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
   - Complete `DOCS_SETUP.md`.
   - Adapt `AUDIENCE.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, `LINKS.md`, and `VISUAL_QA.md`.
   - Keep or archive setup files according to maintainer decision.

9. Establish the initial roadmap and review rhythm.
   - Define the first meaningful documentation milestone and its validation or
     publication objective.
   - Identify the next small structure, drafting, review and QA steps.
   - Plan regular Conventional Commits below the milestone and a separate
     milestone closure commit.

10. Confirm initialization completion.
   - Verify that identity, purpose, scope, audience, roadmap, source handling,
     Quarto and publication model, QA expectations, decision-record needs and
     retained template files are documented consistently.
   - Resolve required `TBD` placeholders before substantive drafting begins.

11. Prepare initialization commit.
   - Review git status.
   - Review generated changes.
   - Normally use a regular `chore:` commit for initialization.
   - Use an unprefixed milestone commit only when initialization also completes
     a genuinely defined and reviewed versioned milestone.
