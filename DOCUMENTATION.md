# Documentation Architecture

This file explains the documentation model of this template repository and the role of its core files.

## Template layers

The repository separates reusable template guidance from project-specific documentation.

Template files describe how a documentation project should be initialized, maintained, reviewed, and evolved. In a derived project, these files should be adapted to the concrete documentation context.

## Core files

- `README.md` and `README.de.md`: Public-facing overview of the template.
- `AGENTS.md`: Automatically loaded entry point that routes AI agents to the
  complete documentation, source-safety and validation guidance.
- `ChatGPT.md`: Versioned AI collaboration model.
- `CODEX.md`: Local operating rules for the assistant.
- `PROJECT_SETUP.md`: Initial repository setup workflow.
- `INITIAL_PROMPT.md`: Reproducible first prompt for project initialization.
- `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md`: Reproducible re-entry prompt for a new context
  window or assistant session.
- `HARMONIZATION_PROMPT.md`: Reproducible source-template, documentation-state
  and roadmap harmonization prompt.
- `RETROSPECTIVE_PROMPT.md`: Reproducible Maintainer-Agent
  documentation-collaboration review prompt.
- `DOCS_SETUP.md`: Documentation-specific setup checklist.
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: Project memory template.
- `DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md`: Ongoing documentation workflow.
- `FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md`: Direct-source, annotated DOCX and annotated PDF
  review workflow.
- `DOCUMENTATION_TYPE_PROFILES.md`: Documentation type profiles and profile-specific QA guidance.
- `QUARTO.md`: Quarto source format, rendering, bilingual structure, and output QA.
- `AUDIENCE.md`: Audience model template.
- `STYLE_GUIDE.md`: Writing and style guidance for technical documentation.
- `SCREENSHOTS.md`: Screenshot and visual artifact guidance.
- `LINKS.md`: Internal and external link discipline.
- `VISUAL_QA.md`: Visual documentation QA checklist.
- `REPOSITORY.md`: Repository organization and lifecycle rules.
- `decisions/`: Decision Records, including DDRs, PDRs and ADRs.

## README language policy

In this template repository, `README.md` is authoritative and `README.de.md` is maintained as a close structural and semantic translation. Derived projects may choose a different authority model, but they must document it and keep parallel README files aligned.

## README badges

Place the badge block directly below the README title and before the AI
Collaboration Note. Use status, version and license in that order, followed
only by badges for real documentation automation such as a site build, render
or link check. Link the standard badges to `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md` and
`LICENSE`.

Badges must reflect maintained documentation state rather than decorate the
README. Derived projects replace template values with their own status,
completed version, actual license and available workflows. Avoid a last-commit
badge because activity is not documentation quality or publication readiness.
Keep English and German badge blocks identical and update static badges with
the metadata they represent.

## Current state and history

Derived projects should distinguish between current documentation state and project history. The main documentation should describe what is true now. Historical rationale belongs in decision records, changelog entries, or dedicated notes when needed.

## Documentation artifacts

Technical documentation may contain Quarto Markdown sources, text, diagrams,
screenshots, exported DOCX or PDF files, generated pages, review annotations,
recordings, and structured reference data. The repository should make clear
which artifacts are source material, which are maintained documentation, which
are review artifacts, and which are generated output.

Rendered or annotated DOCX and PDF files do not replace their maintained
sources. Accepted feedback is complete only after it has been transferred to
the authoritative source and validated there.

## Sensitive material

Raw screenshots, logs, exports, configuration values, internal URLs, and user data can be sensitive. They should not be committed or read by the assistant until the maintainer has confirmed that this is appropriate.

If documentation requires evidence from sensitive material, create sanitized derivatives or redacted artifacts whenever possible.
